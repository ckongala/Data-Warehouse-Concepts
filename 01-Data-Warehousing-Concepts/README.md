# Data Warehouse Overview

## What is a Data Warehouse?

A **Data Warehouse** is a system that aggregates data from multiple sources, typically for reporting and analytics purposes. It acts as a central repository where data from different operational systems or external sources are copied and stored for analysis. The data in a data warehouse supports data-driven decision-making.

- **Important Notes:**
  - Data is **copied**, not moved from its original source.
  - Data warehouse rules are designed to structure data in a way that makes it easy to analyze.
  
### Data Warehouse Rules:
1. **Multiple Data Sources:** Data comes from various sources like transactional systems and external databases.
2. **Subject-Oriented:** Data is organized by subject areas (e.g., sales, finance, etc.).
3. **Time-Variant:** Data is stored with historical context for analysis over time.
4. **Non-Volatile:** Data is loaded periodically without being altered or deleted.

Ultimately, the goal is to support **data-driven decision-making**.

## Reasons for Building a Data Warehouse

### 1. **Support Data-Driven Decision Making**
A data warehouse helps businesses make decisions based on historical, current, and predictive data. By analyzing large amounts of data, organizations can uncover valuable insights that guide decisions.

### 2. **One-Stop Data Storage**
Data warehouses centralize data that might otherwise be scattered across multiple transactional and operational applications. This makes it easier for users to analyze data without needing to gather it from multiple disparate sources.

By integrating data into a single location, we enable **Business Intelligence (BI)**. This eliminates the complexities of retrieving data from various sources and simplifies the decision-making process.

## Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake

### Data Warehouse:
- Built on relational databases (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle, IBM Db2).
- Primarily used for structured data and analytical queries.
- Stores historical data and is typically optimized for querying and reporting.

### Data Lake:
- Built on big data platforms (e.g., Hadoop, AWS S3).
- Supports the storage of large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.
- Works with "big data" concepts, often referred to as the **Three V's of Big Data**:
  - **Volume**: Large quantities of data.
  - **Velocity**: Fast data ingestion.
  - **Variety**: Different data formats (e.g., text, video, logs, etc.).

Both data warehouses and data lakes contribute to data-driven decision-making, but they serve different purposes. A **Data Lake** can hold raw data, while a **Data Warehouse** organizes and processes that data for reporting.

## Data Warehouse vs. Data Virtualization

### Data Virtualization:
- Unlike data warehousing, **data virtualization** does not involve copying data.
- It allows access to data directly from its original locations as needed for reporting and analytics.
- Acts as a read-only, distributed database, enabling on-demand data access.

Data virtualization can complement data warehouses and data lakes by offering real-time data access and improving decision-making capabilities.

## Simple End-to-End Data Warehousing Process

### Key Points:

1. **Data Warehouse Construction**:
   - A data warehouse is built by pulling data from various systems and applications. The sources are identified, and data is copied into the warehouse.

2. **ETL Process**:
   - **ETL** stands for **Extract**, **Transform**, and **Load**. It is a process used to move data from source systems into the data warehouse.
   - **Extract**: Data is retrieved from different sources.
   - **Transform**: Data is cleaned, transformed, and formatted as needed.
   - **Load**: Transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse.

3. **Data Marts**:
   - After the data is stored in the warehouse, it can be distributed to **Data Marts**. Data marts are smaller, subject-specific subsets of the data, tailored for particular users or business units.

### Analogy:
- **Data Sources** are like **suppliers**.
- The **Data Warehouse** acts as a **wholesaler** that collects and stores the data.
- **Data Marts** are like **retailers** that provide specific data subsets to users.

## Conclusion

A **Data Warehouse** is an essential tool for businesses that want to analyze and make decisions based on integrated, historical, and timely data. It simplifies the process of data collection, storage, and analysis, providing powerful insights that drive informed decision-making.
